# Chromebook Keyboard Layout

A Magisk/KernelSU module designed to provide Chromebook's keyboard layout and shortcuts into Android (i.e., Bliss OS), ranging from the following:

- Media Keys
- Key combos to other keys (PgUp, PgDn, Home, End, etc.)

**NOTE:** This is intended for use on Android only, i.e., [Bliss OS](https://blissos.org/) (not on other systems like Linux)

---

Currently, only the media keys work as intended.

Future releases will provide shortcuts to other keys.
